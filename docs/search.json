the single largest factor in determining number of riders. It gave negative weights to weekdays and surprisingly holidays as well. The warmer months have higher weights than the winter months, but early spring and fall have higher weights than summer does. I believe that the temperature weight compensates for the lower weights of the summer months to make it so the model still predicts the highest ridership numbers during the summer. This makes sense, since every day during the summer in DC is hot… The year also was given a positive weight, reflecting the higher ridership numbers in 2012 compared to 2011."

The perceptron was able to achieve 100% accuracy!\n\n\nRuntime Complexity of the Update Step\nThe update contains multiple individual steps occuring in sequence. We will look at them all individually\nFirst lets look at making the prediction: np.sign(np.dot(self.w, X_[i])). This operation does a 1xp dot px1 operation. This specific step is O(p).\nNext, lets look at the forming of the gate: (y_[i] * y_pred) < 0. This is clearly O(1).\nNow for the update: self.w + false_check * (y_[i] * X_[i]). The major component here is the scalar * vector operation. Since the vector is of length p, this is O(p) as well.\nWe could end there and be done, but we check the overall accuracy as part of the update step: (np.dot(self.w, X_.T) > 0). This is a dot product operation of 1xp vector and a pxn matrix. Therefore, this step has a runtime of O(pn).\nSince all of the steps are done in sequence, the runtime for the total update step is O(pn)."

The syntax for writing math is very similar to the syntax used in the \\(\\LaTeX\\) markup language. For example, $f(x) \\approx y$ renders to \\(f(x) \\approx y\\). To place complex mathematical expressions on their own lines, use double dollar signs. For example, the expression\n$$\\mathcal{L}(a, b) = \\sum_{i = 1}^n (ax_i + b - y_i)^2$$\nrenders to:\n\\[\\mathcal{L}(a, b) = \\sum_{i = 1}^n (ax_i + b - y_i)^2\\;.\\]\nBehind the scenes, math is powered by the MathJax engine.

It seems that the model does not significantly alter its prediction based off disability for white people, but for every other racial category the changes are quite large. These numbers almost make sense when you look at the above pie plots: Asian’s and American Indian’s with disabilities are twice as likely to be working. This would partially explain why their false negative rates are high, but it wouldn’t explain the other races with very high FNRs.\n\n\n\nfor feat, importance in zip(feature_categories, clf[1].feature_importances_):\n    print(f\"{feat}:, {round(importance*100, 2)}%\")\n\nSCHL:, 36.14%\nMAR:, 2.65%\nAGEP:, 46.12%\nDIS:, 11.35%\nSEX:, 3.1%\nNATIVITY:, 0.64%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA model trained to predict unemployment could be used for a variety of purposes. Here are two examples where it could be used:\n\nIt could be used to direct job ads to people that are unemployed, hoping to find people that are looking for work.\nIt could be used to direct job ads to only people that are employed, viewing the unemployed as undesirable.\n\nIn this sense, depending on its application, it could both help and hurt unemployed people. If we take American Indians as an example, since my model only had a very low FPR for them, they would be less likely to be excluded from job ads targeted to unemployed people, and more likely to be excluded from ads targeted to employed people.\nThe actual real world applications for my model specifically are slim. For starters, it is a very mediocre classifier, but, also, a model trained to predict employment status from the identifiers that I used could only be used by somebody with access to a bizarre dataset. The features I used are generally not easier to come by than employment status is to gain directly. Furthermore, the features that are harder to acquire are the more important ones. Perhaps Instagram or Facebook could analyze your account to come up with age, sex, and relationship status, but level of schooling and disability seem much harder, and for little payoff. To put it plainly, anybody that really needs employment status usually has the ability to ask directly, and if they can’t ask then they’re probably not going to have the data necessary to predict it.\nI think my model does display some problematic bias. The most concerning issue to me is the error rate balance. More specifically, I am concerned by how high the FPR is for American Indians and how high the FNR is for Asians. Most of the other values are relatively in line with each other, but these two stand out. If this model were to be implemented it, then American Indians and Asians would not be properly represented.\nBeyond concerns of bias, I think my model is incredibly innocuous. A model that predicted employment status through gait or clothing would be much more dangerous since it could be employed so much wider. The issue of acquiring the data necessary makes my model highly impractical to actually use by someone with malicious intentions."
