abstract = {Cancer is one of the most common causes of death in the world. It is characterized by the multi-stage transformation of normal cells into tumor cells. Early cancer detection can significantly reduce its consequences, which was the objective of many machine learning (ML) published studies. However, most of them focused on microarray, gene expression, or publicly available medical datasets. Almost none offered an approach for predicting cancer through analysis of sequential data, such as Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. This paper presents a sequential ML approach to predict the occurrence of lung cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, and liver cell cancer using EHR data. The accuracy of sequence learning models based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional gated recurrent units (GRU) were compared to traditional ML methods based on multilayer perceptron, random forest, decision tree, and K-nearest neighbor. The models were trained and tested on 50,606 patient hospitalization histories. Unsupervised and supervised data reduction methods (singular value decomposition (SVD) and a neural network embedding layer) were applied to overcome the challenges of high-dimensionality and sparsity of EHR data. The results provided evidence that for this application GRU outperforms alternatives based on accuracy, Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity (recall), specificity, precision, and F1 score. It was the best performing model with accuracy between 81% (breast cancer) and 88% (liver cancer) on balanced out of sample EHRs. Multilayer perceptron and LSTM manifested comparable performances (accuracies between 78% and 87%) among the alternatives, while decision tree was the worst-performing model. The findings of this study could potentially aid medical professionals in cancer diagnostics, treatment, and prevention. In particular, experiments confirmed that GRU could accurately predict cancer by learning from simplified patient representations using an embedding layer or SVD. Therefore, GRU's predictions could be used in early cancer detection, potentially improving patients' survival rates.}

abstract={Multivariate time series data in practical applications, such as health care, geoscience, and biology, are characterized by a variety of missing values. In time series prediction and other related tasks, it has been noted that missing values and their missing patterns are often correlated with the target labels, a.k.a., informative missingness. There is very limited work on exploiting the missing patterns for effective imputation and improving prediction performance. In this paper, we develop novel deep learning models, namely GRU-D, as one of the early attempts. GRU-D is based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a state-of-the-art recurrent neural network. It takes two representations of missing patterns, i.e., masking and time interval, and effectively incorporates them into a deep model architecture so that it not only captures the long-term temporal dependencies in time series, but also utilizes the missing patterns to achieve better prediction results. Experiments of time series classification tasks on real-world clinical datasets (MIMIC-III, PhysioNet) and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance and provide useful insights for better understanding and utilization of missing values in time series analysis.},

ABSTRACT = {Increasingly available open medical and health datasets encourage data-driven research with a promise of improving patient care through knowledge discovery and algorithm development. Among efficient approaches to such high-dimensional problems are a number of machine learning methods, which are applied in this paper to pressure ulcer prediction in modular critical care data. An inherent property of many health-related datasets is a high number of irregularly sampled time-variant and scarcely populated features, often exceeding the number of observations. Although machine learning methods are known to work well under such circumstances, many choices regarding model and data processing exist. In particular, this paper address both theoretical and practical aspects related to the application of six classification models to pressure ulcers, while utilizing one of the largest available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) databases. Random forest, with an accuracy of 96%, is the best-performing approach among the considered machine learning algorithms.},

abstract="PURPOSE: Build machine learning models for predicting pressure ulcer nursing adverse event, and find an optimal model that predicts the occurrence of pressure ulcer accurately. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospectively enrolled 5814 patients, of which 1673 suffer from pressure ulcer events. Support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN) models were used to construct the pressure ulcer prediction models, respectively. A total of 19 variables are included, and the importance of screening variables is evaluated. Meanwhile, the performance of the prediction models is evaluated and compared. RESULTS: The experimental results show that the four pressure ulcer prediction models all achieve good performance. Also, the AUC values of the four models are all greater than 0.95. Besides, the comparison of the four models indicates that RF model achieves a higher accuracy for the prediction of pressure ulcer. CONCLUSION: This research verifies the feasibility of developing a management system for predicting nursing adverse event based on big data technology and machine learning technology. The random forest and decision tree model are more suitable for constructing a pressure ulcer prediction model. This study provides a reference for future pressure ulcer risk warning based on big data.",

Identifying accurate risk factors of pressure ulcers is essential to determining appropriate prevention strategies; in this work we examine medication, diagnosis, and traditional Braden pressure ulcer assessment scale measurements as patient features. In order to predict pressure ulcer incidence and better understand the structure of related risk factors, we construct Bayesian networks from patient features. Bayesian network nodes (features) and edges (conditional dependencies) are simplified with statistical network techniques. Upon reviewing a network visualization of our model, our clinician collaborators were able to identify strong relationships between risk factors widely recognized as associated with pressure ulcers.},

abstract={Despite the relevance of pressure ulcers (PU) in inpatient care, the predictive power and role of care-related risk factors (e.g. anesthesia) remain unclear. We investigated the predictability of PU incidence and its association with multiple care variables. We included all somatic cases between 2014 and 2018 with length of stay{\thinspace}≥{\thinspace}2d in a German university hospital. For regression analyses and prediction we used Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) as nonparametric modeling approach. To assess predictive accuracy, we compared BART, random forest, logistic regression (LR) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) using area under the curve (AUC), confusion matrices and multiple indicators of predictive performance (e.g. sensitivity, specificity, F1, positive/ negative predictive value) in the full dataset and subgroups. Analysing 149,006 cases revealed high predictive variable importance and associations between incident PU and ventilation, age, anesthesia (≥{\thinspace}1 h) and number of care-involved wards. Despite high AUCs (range 0.89--0.90), many false negative predictions led to low sensitivity (range 0.04--0.10). Ventilation, age, anesthesia and number of care-involved wards were associated with incident PU. Using anesthesia as a proxy for immobility, an hourly repositioning is indicated. The low sensitivity indicates major challenges for correctly predicting PU based on routine data.},

abstract = {Abstract The effective approach on pressure ulcer (PU) prevention regarding patient safety in the hospital context was evaluated. Studies were identified from searches in EBSCO host, PubMed, and WebofScience databases from 2009 up to December 2018. Studies were selected if they were published in English, French, Portuguese, or Spanish; incidence of PUs was the primary outcome; participants were adults (≥18 years) admitted in hospital wards and/or units. The review included 26 studies. Studies related to prophylactic dressings applied in the sacrum, trochanters, and/or heels, education for health care professionals, and preventive skin care and system reminders on-screen inpatient care plan were effective in decreasing PUs. Most of the studies related to multiple intervention programmes were effective in decreasing PU occurrence. Single interventions, namely support surfaces and repositioning, were not always effective in preventing PUs. Repositioning only was effective when supported by technological pressure-mapping feedback or by a patient positioning system. Risk-assessment tools are not effective in preventing PUs. PUs in the hospital context are still a worldwide issue related to patient safety. Multiple intervention programmes were more effective in decreasing PU occurrence than single interventions in isolation. Single interventions (prophylactic dressings, support surfaces, repositioning, preventive skin care, system reminders, and education for health care professionals) were effective in decreasing PUs, which was always in compliance with other preventive measures. These results provide an overview of effective approaches that should be considered when establishing evidence-based guidelines to hospital health care professionals and administrators for clinical practice effective in preventing PUs.},

abstract = {Objectives To determine the national and state incidence levels of newly hospital-acquired pressure ulcers (PUs) in Medicare beneficiaries and to describe the clinical and demographic characteristics and outcomes of these individuals. Design Retrospective secondary analysis of the national Medicare Patient Safety Monitoring System (MPSMS) database. Setting Medicare-eligible hospitals across the United States and select territories. Participants Fifty-one thousand eight hundred forty-two randomly selected hospitalized fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries discharged from the hospital between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2007. Measurements Data were abstracted from the MPSMS, which collects information on multiple hospital adverse events. Results Of the 51,842 individuals in the MPSMS 2006/07 sample, 2,313 (4.5\%) developed at least one new PU during their hospitalization. The mortality risk–adjusted odds ratios were 2.81 (95\% confidence interval (CI) = 2.44–3.23) for in-hospital mortality, 1.69 (95\% CI = 1.61–1.77) for mortality within 30 days after discharge, and 1.33 (95\% CI = 1.23–1.45) for readmission within 30 days. The hospital risk–adjusted main length of stay was 4.8 days (95\% CI = 4.7–5.0 days) for individuals who did not develop PUs and 11.2 days (95\% CI = 10.19–11.4) for those with hospital-acquired PUs (P < .001). The Northeast region and Missouri had the highest incidence rates (4.6\% and 5.9\%, respectively). Conclusion Individuals who developed PUs were more likely to die during the hospital stay, have generally longer hospital lengths of stay, and be readmitted within 30 days after discharge.},
